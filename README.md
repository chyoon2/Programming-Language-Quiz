#### By: _**Christopher Yoon**_

_This is a website for potential young coders to visit to see which language they should learn first. I have been able to narrow down a handful of questions that after they are answered the user will recieve a language that is most suitable based on their preferences. This is by no means and end all be all, but just another tool for burgeoning coders to use in the early days of their journey._
